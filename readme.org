* Flyer.js

  [[./doc/intro.png]]

  *flyer.js* is a lightweight messaging library written for
  clojurescript & javascript. 

  It provides broadcast messaging between frames, iframes, and
  windows.

  Here is a [[http://benzap.github.com/flyer.js][demo page]], which is in the works.

* Including flyer in your clojurescript project
** Leiningen
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
   [flyer "1.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
#+END_SRC

** Gradle
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
compile "flyer:flyer:1.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
#+END_SRC

** Maven
#+BEGIN_SRC xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>flyer</groupId>
  <artifactId>flyer</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
#+END_SRC

* Features and Operation
  - Simple API, from which you can build more elaborate messaging
    systems.
  - Messages are broadcasted to all frames and registered windows,
    regardless of whether or not they want them (hence, the name)
  - Frames can subscribe to specific channels, and can regex-match
    to broader topics being sent on that channel
* Javascript Configuration
  - Include /flyer.js/ at the end of your page body
    #+BEGIN_SRC html
<script type="text/javascript" src="./js/flyer.js"></script>
    #+END_SRC
  - In situations where you would use *window.open*, use
    *flyer.window.open* instead. This is required in order to track
    window references.

** flyer.broadcast([Options])
*** Options
    - channel :: the channel you wish to broadcast on. default is "*",
                 which stands for *all channels*
    - topic :: the topic of your broadcast message. default is "*",
               which stands for *all topics*
    - data :: any JSON serializable object
    - target :: determines what type of target domain is expected to
                receive this message. By default, the target is
                "all", but it can be set to "local", or a target
                domain of your choosing.
*** Examples
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
flyer.broadcast({
  channel: "default",
  topic: "person.insert",
  data: {id: 1, name: "Ben"}
});

flyer.broadcast({
  channel: "default",
  topic: "person.delete",
  data: {id: 1}
});
    #+END_SRC

** flyer.subscribe([Options])
*** Options
    - channel :: the channel you wish to subscribe to. default is "*",
                 which stands for *all channels*
    - topic :: the topic you wish to subscribe to. default is "*",
               which stands for *all topics*. Note that this can
               also be a string representation of a regex expression.
    - callback :: callback function of the form *function(data,
                  [topic], [channel] [origin])* that you wish to call when the
                  subscription is made.
    - origin :: refers to the origin, or domain from which the
                messages will be received. The default is *all*, but
                it can be set to *local*, or to another origin
*** Examples
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
flyer.subscribe({
  channel: "default",
  topic: "person.*",
  callback: function(data, topic, channel) {
    if (topic == "person.insert") {
      console.log("Inserted Person! - " + data.name);
    }
    else if (topic == "person.delete") {
      console.log("Removed Person with id - " + data.id);
    }
  }
});
    #+END_SRC

** flyer.window.open(url, name, [Options])
   /follows the same API as window.open/

   [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.open][Mozilla API Page]]

* Clojurescript API (untested)
** flyer.messaging/broadcast
*** (broadcast & options)
*** Options
    - channel :: the channel you wish to broadcast on. default is "*",
                 which stands for *all channels*
    - topic :: the topic of your broadcast message. default is "*",
               which stands for *all topics*
    - data :: any JSON serializable object
    - target :: refers to the target origin, or domain in which to
                post the message. The default is *:all*, but it can
                also be *:local*, or a target origin of your choosing
*** Example
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojurescript
(broadcast :channel "default"
           :topic "person.insert"
           :data {:id 1 :name "Ben"}
           :origin :all)
    #+END_SRC

*** (subscribe & options)
*** Options
    - channel :: the channel you wish to subscribe to. default is "*",
                 which stands for *all channels*
    - topic :: the topic you wish to subscribe to. default is "*",
               which stands for *all topics*. Note that this can

* Example
  [[http://benzap.github.io/flyer.js][Demo Page]]

* Project Compilation
  1. Clone this Repository
  2. Install [[http://leiningen.org/][Leiningen]]
  3. cd into flyer.js directory
  4. type *lein deps*
  5. type *lein cljsbuild once*
  6. resulting *flyer.js* should now be present in
     ./resources/public/js/
* Issues
  - In order to communicate with frames and windows that are within an
    external window, you need to replace *window.open* with
    *flyer.window.open*
  - The size of *flyer.js* is quite big, at a whopping 1mb. This is
    due to the nature of compilation. Use flyer.min.js to bring this
    down to 100kb
  - Refreshing the parent window of an opened window will break any
    messages from being broadcasted throughout the application. This
    is due to the external window frame losing its parent
    (window.opener).
  - external windows can be refreshed without losing communications,
    however, it requires that flyer.js be included within that html
    page

* Technical Details
** How it works
   flyer.js works by hijacking window.postMessage, and the event
   generated, which can be attached to through the "message" event

   [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.postMessage][Mozilla API Page]]

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
//attaching a listener to frame[0]
window.frame[0].addEventListener("message", 
  function(event) { 
    console.log(event.data, event.origin)
  });

//posting a message to frame[0]
window.frame[0].postMessage("some message", "*")
   #+END_SRC

   It also does a few other things:

   - generates a list of frames, by performing a traversal through all
     of the frames and external windows.     
   - wraps the functionality into two sane functions.

   The full set of steps when performing a broadcast:

   1. Generate list of frames and external window frames (flyer.traversal)
   2. Generate a message, by stringifying a defined message object
      {channel:..., topic:..., data:...} (flyer.messaging)
   3. For each frame, f, perform f.postMessage(msg, target)

   The full steps when performing a subscribe:

   1. Grab the callback function, and add a "message" event listener
      decorated with a set of rules
      - Does it have the same channel?
      - Does it have the same topic?
      - If it isn't the same topic, does the provided callback topic regex
        match the broadcasted topic?
      - Does it have a lax origin, or is it accepting all origins?
   2. If it passes the conditions in step 1, the main callback is
      called with the results of the broadcast. Further conditions can
      be provided at the developers discretion.
